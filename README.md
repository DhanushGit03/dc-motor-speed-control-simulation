# DC Motor Speed Control Simulation üöÄ

This repository contains a Simulink-based simulation project to model and control the speed of a DC motor using classical control techniques such as the **PID controller**. This project is useful for students and enthusiasts interested in control systems, modeling, and real-time simulation with MATLAB & Simulink.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Model a DC motor using its physical parameters.
- Design and tune a PID controller to maintain desired motor speed.
- Analyze performance (overshoot, settling time, rise time).
- Visualize system response with scopes and plots.
- Demonstrate closed-loop speed regulation under step inputs.

| File/Folder                 | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MyModel.slx`              | Main Simulink model file                                     |
| `MyModel.slxc`             | Simulink cache file (auto-generated, ignored going forward)  |
| `Machine_Parameters.m`     | MATLAB script defining motor parameters                      |
| `DCMotorSpeedControlSimulation.prj` | Simulink Project file                            |
| `resources/project/`       | Additional model assets or references                        |

**Note:** You can ignore `.slxc` ‚Äî it's an auto-generated Simulink cache file not needed for version control or manual editing.
